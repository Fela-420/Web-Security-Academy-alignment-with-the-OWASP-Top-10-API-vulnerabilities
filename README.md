| **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)**           | Access Control & Privilege Escalation    | Users can access or modify objects (records, files, accounts, orders, etc.) they do not own by changing IDs or parameters. |
| **Broken Authentication**                              | Authentication Vulnerabilities           | Flaws that allow bypassing login, session hijacking, account takeover, or weak credential handling.                        |
| **OAuth 2.0 Authentication Vulnerabilities**           | Authentication Vulnerabilities           | Misconfigurations in OAuth flows enabling token theft, account takeover, open redirect abuse, or unauthorized login.       |
| **JWT Attacks**                                        | Authentication Vulnerabilities           | Weak signing, algorithm confusion, missing validation, or token tampering leading to authentication bypass.                |
| **Broken Object Property Level Authorization (BOPLA)** | Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities          | Ability to modify hidden or restricted object fields (e.g., role, isAdmin, balance) through API requests.                  |
| **Unrestricted Resource Consumption**                  | Availability & Abuse                     | APIs or endpoints allow unlimited actions, requests, or processing leading to DoS or financial/resource abuse.             |
| **Race Conditions**                                    | Concurrency & Logic Flaws                | Flaws caused by simultaneous requests that bypass limits, duplicate actions, or break business rules.                      |
| **File Upload Vulnerabilities**                        | Input Handling & RCE                     | Improper validation of uploaded files enabling malware upload, XSS, path traversal, or remote code execution.              |
| **Broken Function Level Authorization**                | Access Control & Privilege Escalation    | Users can access restricted functions or endpoints (admin features, internal APIs) without proper permissions.             |
| **Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows**    | Business Logic Vulnerabilities           | Critical operations (refunds, transfers, promotions, approvals) lack proper authorization or validation.                   |
| **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**                 | Server-Side Attacks                      | Attacker forces the server to make internal or external requests, potentially exposing internal services or metadata.      |
| **Security Misconfiguration**                          | Configuration Weaknesses                 | Insecure default settings, verbose errors, exposed admin panels, weak TLS, or unsafe headers.                              |
| **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**               | Client-Side & API Security               | Improper CORS policies allow malicious websites to read sensitive API responses.                                           |
| **Information Disclosure**                             | Data Exposure                            | Sensitive information leaked via errors, debug endpoints, backups, metadata, or misconfigured storage.                     |
| **HTTP Host Header Attacks**                           | Request Handling                         | Manipulating the Host header to poison caches, reset passwords, or generate malicious links.                               |
| **HTTP Request Smuggling**                             | Request Parsing                          | Conflicting request interpretations between proxies and servers enabling bypasses or cache poisoning.                      |
| **Improper Inventory Management**                      | API Testing                              | Untracked, outdated, or undocumented APIs expose hidden attack surfaces.                                                   |
| **Unsafe Consumption of APIs**                         | API Testing                              | Trusting data from third-party APIs without validation leading to injection, logic abuse, or data corruption.              |
